            The Students’ Federation of India inherits with pride the
            anti-imperialist, patriotic, secular, democratic, and progressive
            legacy of the Indian people’s struggle for national liberation from
            the British colonial rule. It carries forward the heritage of the
            progressive student movement of our country, which has always
            considered itself an inseparable part of the broader struggle for
            social transformation. It is this legacy that the Students’ Federation
            of India holds aloft in its slogan of “Independence, Democracy, and
            Socialism!”
          </p>

            The Students’ Federation of India cannot be oblivious of the fact that
            our country had to suffer centuries of colonial slavery and ruthless
            exploitation of foreign imperialism and native feudalism. This led to
            mass-scale poverty, hunger, misery and aggravation of social evils for
            the vast majority of the people and forced them to lead a sub-human
            life. The growing consciousness against the social evils saw the birth
            of a social reform movement led by great rational thinkers. The
            people’s fight to put an end to the British colonial rule and
            feudalism gave birth to the historic national movement for
            independence, in which students played an active role.

            The formation of the All India Students’ Federation on 12th August
            1936 marked the consolidation of the progressive and radical trends
            within the Indian student community and the beginning of the organized
            student movement in India. The distinctive character of AISF was the
            manner in which it organized within its fold students irrespective of
            their political affiliation under the slogan of anti-imperialism.
            Also, on the world-scale, rapid advances were being made in the USSR
            vis-à-vis the deepening crisis in the industrially advanced capitalist
            countries, which attracted students to the Left ideology.
          </p>
          <p>
            The debates during the formative years of the AISF saw the
            crystallization of the two basic premises that have since guided the
            progressive student movement. The first is the right and the necessity
            of students to organize themselves in defense of their rights and to
            struggle for an education system that would meet the needs of the vast
            majority of our people. The second is the recognition that such a
            struggle can be successful only when combined with the broader
            struggles of other sections of the people.
          </p>
          <p>
            The post World War II years, which brought about the decisive defeat
            of fascism, also witnessed massive popular resistance worldwide
            against colonialism. During this period, the national liberation
            struggles in various countries gained momentum, and India was not an
            exception. The AISF stood in solidarity with the mass struggles, at
            times playing a significant role. As a culmination of these struggles,
            our country finally attained political independence. However, these
            were also the times when the communal divide aided by the British was
            deepening that finally led to the partition of the country.
          </p>

            Independence in 1947 brought high hopes that the progressive and
            democratic ideals of the freedom struggle would be realized. In the
            initial decades, significant achievements were registered in building
            up a democratic polity and breaking the colonial stagnation of the
            economy. These, however, were halting and inadequate to meet the needs
            of our vast millions. This was because the process was fraught with
            contradictions — the central one being that the new regime adopted a
            capitalist path of development on the basis of a historic compromise
            with landlordism and imperialism. As­­­­ a result, the stranglehold of
            feudal and semi-feudal relations remained largely intact.
            Consequently, neither economic growth nor democracy could have a
            stable base. In the sphere of education too, while there was some
            progress in the post-independence period, it was in the main limited
            to a privileged few, and the Constitutional directive for universal
            and compulsory primary education remained largely unfulfilled.

            The different perspectives regarding the policies of the ruling
            className led to a serious rift in the student movement. A section of
            the leadership insisted on supporting the line of the then Congress
            government, thus making student movement tail the government’s
            policies. An opposing section stood for mobilizing the student
            community against the government policies. Due to the dominance of the
            former view, the AISF by the decade of sixties was robbed of the
            potential of struggling against the anti-student and anti-people
            policies of the then Congress government. This forced various state
            unit organizations to function independently. It became essential to
            build a new militant organization moored in the earlier fine tradition
            of the AISF, which led to the formation of the Students’ Federation of
            India [SFI] at an all India conference held from 27-30 December 1970
            at Thiruvananthapuram.

            The Students’ Federation of India, since its inception, successfully
            championed the slogan of ‘Study & Struggle’ and effectively countered
            the disruptive theory of ‘Student Power’ that ascribed to the student
            community the leadership of social revolution. The Students’
            Federation of India stood firmly against attacks on democratic rights
            and fought against the imposition of emergency. Its slogan of
            “Education for all, Jobs for all” found a strong appeal within the
            student masses of the country, rallying them to the fold of the
            movement and the organization. The Students’ Federation of India
            consistently stood in solidarity with the anti-imperialist national
            liberation movements across the globe.

            The introduction of new education policy in 1986 saw a renewed attack
            on the public education system. Students’ Federation of India
            initiated a united struggle against these proposals intended to
            drastically curtail the scope of education in the government sector.
            SFI was able to withstand the anti-reservation stir against the Mandal
            Commission recommendations due to the principled position it had
            taken. It fought in defense of the unity and integrity of the country,
            for communal amity, social justice and made heroic sacrifices in these
            struggles.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Students’ Federation of India is fully aware of the fact that the
            imposition of the neo-liberal economic policies on our country is
            disastrous to the vast majority of the people, which deprives large
            sections of students from access to education and employment. On the
            other hand, the right wing communal forces systematically undermine
            even the modest democratic and secular content of our education system
            to propagate their politics of hate and religious frenzy in an attempt
            to draw a wedge between different communities. Students’ Federation of
            India has been at the forefront of struggles against this dual danger,
            in defense of students’ rights and for upholding the secular,
            democratic character and sovereignty of our Republic
          </p>
          <p>
            The earlier generations of the student community played their proud
            and glorious role in fighting for the achievement of political
            independence from the British. Following their example, it is the
            historic and patriotic duty of our generation of students to take an
            active interest in the struggle for elimination of the evil legacies
            of dependence, backwardness and poverty, and laying the foundation for
            a really free, prosperous, and progressive future for our people. The
            Students’ Federation of India presents before the student community a
            programme that guides them to achieve a democratic, scientific and
            progressive education system. It commits to carry forward the
            uncompromising struggle for the establishment of a socialist society,
            a social order free from all kinds of exploitation.
